## ![](https://dfk-hv.b-cdn.net/website-media/images/jewel-icon.png) GENERAL

### What is DeFi Kingdoms?

DeFi Kingdoms (DFK) is a game, a decentralized exchange (DEX), a liquidity pool (LP) opportunity, and a market of rare utility-driven NFTs, that all plays out seamlessly in the incredibly nostalgic form of fantasy pixel art.

DFK launched on August 22, 2021 as a DEX with LP farming opportunities, and additional features are constantly being added.

### What blockchain is DeFi Kingdoms using?

DeFi Kingdoms is using the Harmony Protocol blockchain with its native coin ONE. ONE can be purchased on most major exchanges, including Binance, Kucoin, Crypto.com, and others.

For information on how to setup your MetaMask wallet, please refer to our tutorial [here](https://defikingdoms.com/tutorial.html) or Harmony's documentation [here](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet).

### What is DeFi and what is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?

DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is an ecosystem of financial applications built on top of blockchain networks that aims to provide financial services without a centralized authority.

A decentralized exchange, or DEX, allows users to exchange funds through smart contracts without relinquishing custody over them until the exchange is finalized. Liquidity is provided to DEXes by individuals who supply a token pair (e.g. ONE and JEWEL) to a liquidity pool, which is then used by the DEX to facilitate trades on that pair.

Users who provide liquidity in this way receive Liquidity Pool (LP) Tokens, which can often be staked to earn additional rewards, such as in [DFK's Gardens](../how-defi-kingdoms-works/the-gardens.md).

You can read more about [decentralized finance](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi) and [decentralized exchanges](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange-dex) at Binance Academy.

### What does it cost to get started and play?

The game itself is free, however there is a transaction cost (gas) every time you interact with the blockchain such as when you make a profile entering the game. Thanks to Harmony's very low fees, these are a fraction of a cent.

Once you're in the game, you can spend as much or as little as you'd like by adding to the liquidity pools in the Marketplace and staking LP Tokens in the Gardens or JEWEL in the Bank.

You can also spend JEWEL to purchase Hero NFTs in the Tavern. They can be used to collect resources through their Professions, and can be paired with other Heroes to Summon new Heroes from the Inner Grove.

### How do I purchase JEWEL?

After logging into [https://game.defikingdoms.com/](https://game.defikingdoms.com) you can purchase JEWEL at the Marketplace from the Trader, Merchant Matoya, with your ONE or with most of Harmony's other tokens.

The contract address for JEWEL is: `0x72Cb10C6bfA5624dD07Ef608027E366bd690048F`

### Where can I find the current price / market cap of JEWEL?

You can see the view the current price and market cap of JEWEL [in the game](https://game.defikingdoms.com) by clicking on your profile picture.

You can also see charts and stats for JEWEL and all other tokens and pairings on the DeFi Kingdoms DEX at: [https://info.defikingdoms.com/](https://info.defikingdoms.com).

### What do I do with my JEWEL tokens?

JEWEL is the lifeblood of the DFK economy, and most in-game actions involve either receiving or spending JEWEL, whether buying/selling heroes, earning through quests, [providing liquidity](../how-defi-kingdoms-works/decentralized-exchange.md) to the DEX and [staking in the Gardens](../how-defi-kingdoms-works/the-gardens.md), or depositing in the Bank vault.

You can also [read more about the JEWEL token](../how-defi-kingdoms-works/jewel-token.md) and its tokenomics.

## ![](https://dfk-hv.b-cdn.net/website-media/images/jewel-icon.png) GAME & DEX MECHANICS

### What is the difference between the Bank and the Gardens?

[The Bank](https://defikingdoms.medium.com/the-bank-depositing-staking-and-claiming-rewards-6ff5368f91ff) is a single-staking pool for JEWEL. When you stake your JEWEL in the Bank, you receive a proportional amount of xJEWEL. Since the ratio between JEWEL and xJEWEL only goes up, when you withdraw from the Bank, you will always receive more JEWEL than you put in!

[The Gardens](../how-defi-kingdoms-works/the-gardens.md) allow you to stake Liquidity Pool (LP) Tokens that you receive from providing liquidity to the DEX. You will receive a return in JEWEL in exchange for staking these tokens.

While the Gardens provide higher returns than the Bank, this comes with greater risk, including impermanent loss (IL) if the value of the tokens in the pair changes relative to one another. You can learn more about impermanent loss from [Binance Academy](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) or by [watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGSSkOq0-Q).

### What is the difference between JEWEL and xJEWEL?

JEWEL is DFK's primary token, used for many in-game transactions. When you deposit JEWEL into the Bank, you receive xJEWEL, which is DFK's governance token. Holding xJEWEL also makes you eligible to receive community airdrops and other rewards.

### What is the APR / interest rate in the Bank?

Because earnings in the Bank are derived from transaction fees that take place within the game, there is no set APR or interest rate. During periods of significant in-game activity, the JEWEL to xJEWEL ratio may rise quite a bit, while being limited at other times.

### What does the 'Claim' button in the bank do?

The 'claim' button collects a portion of the fees earned from in-game transactions and market-buys JEWEL with them, increasing the ratio of JEWEL to xJEWEL. When you withdraw your JEWEL from the Bank, you will have more than you put in! Since 'claiming' is distributed at once among all players, you may not see any immediate change from pushing the button.

### Why are some of my JEWEL tokens locked?

In order to ensure the stability of JEWEL for the long term, a portion of the JEWEL tokens earned in the Gardens are temporarily locked and cannot be used in any way. These locked tokens will slowly become unlocked beginning in Epoch 51 (est. Q3 2022). The unlocking process can also be accelerated through Mining quests. [Learn more about DFK's tokenomics.](../how-defi-kingdoms-works/the-gardens.md)

### How long is an Epoch?

An epoch in DFK is 302,400 blocks on the Harmony blockchain, and the length of each epoch depends on the average block speed on Harmony. Epochs were calculated to 302,400 blocks so that each epoch would equal one week assuming a speed of 2 seconds per block.

### Why did my JEWEL in the Gardens get claimed?

JEWEL rewards from the Gardens are automatically claimed whenever you deposit or withdraw LP Tokens into the Gardens.

### When does the fee schedule for the Gardens begin/reset?

The [withdrawal fee schedule](../how-defi-kingdoms-works/the-gardens.md#garden-staking-deposit-and-withdrawal-fees) for the Gardens begins when you first stake your LP Tokens into a specific garden, and is separate for every garden. The fees reset whenever you withdraw LP Tokens from a garden.

## ![](https://dfk-hv.b-cdn.net/website-media/images/jewel-icon.png) HEROES & SUMMONING

### What do Heroes do? Do I need a Hero?

Heroes are central to gameplay in DeFi Kingdoms. They can summon new heroes, be sent on quests, engage in professions, and eventually fight each other in PVP. While you can still use the DEX, Gardens, and Bank without a hero, we think everyone will enjoy the opportunities that heroes bring!

[Read more about Heroes.](../how-defi-kingdoms-works/the-heroes.md)

### Where do I get a Hero?

Heroes are available for purchase from other players in the Tavern, and can also be rented at the Portal to assist in the summoning process!

[Read more about buying, selling, and renting out heroes at the Tavern.](https://defikingdoms.medium.com/the-tavern-buy-sell-and-rent-out-heroes-85a661b23b6f)

### What is the difference between Gen0 Heroes and later generations?

Gen0 heroes are the originators of all other heroes in the game, and as such, are limited in number and highly collectible. Because they are responsible for seeding genes to all other Heroes, Gen0 heroes do not have a limit on the number of times that they can summon.

### Will there be another Gen0 Hero sale?

The Gen0 hero sale took place on September 30 and all 2000 heroes sold out in 11 minutes! As these heroes are limited and collectible, there will not be another Gen0 hero sale like this one.

However, since Gen0 heroes are the only way to seed new genes into the hero pool, as DFK expands to new realms and blockchains, we may eventually sell additional Gen0 heroes in the future to introduce new classes or other hero features into the game. This will be done carefully as to not dilute the value of existing Gen0 heroes.

### How do I summon a new Hero?

If you have two heroes, you can go to the Portal and summon another one. You will need some JEWEL and at least 20 Gaia's Tears.

If you only have one hero, you can rent one from another player at the Portal to assist in the summoning process.

[Read more about Hero Summoning.](gameplay/heroes/summoning.md)

### Where can I get Gaia's Tears to summon Heroes?

Gaia's Tears are available as loot drops from Professions Quests. Fishing, Foraging, Gardening, and Mining all have a chance to drop Gaia's Tears.

Additionally, Gaia's Tears can be earned in the Wishing Well mini-quests, which can be accessed near the castle on the overworld map screen or within the Meditation Circle zone. As long as you have at least one hero, you can send them on a Wishing Well quest, which will deplete their stamina and gift you with a possibility to receive some of Gaia's Tears. There is a chance to receive no tears per quest.

Some players have added their Gaia's Tears (DFKTEARS) to a JEWEL-DFKTEARS liquidity pool in the Marketplace.

### I didn't receive a new Hero from summoning!

Once you infuse a crystal with the essence of two heroes, it must be brought to the summoning portal to bring the hero forth from the Inner Grove.

If you do not see the Infused Crystal after the summoning transaction successfully goes through, please try to refresh the page and open MetaMask for a few seconds (preferably on the Asset overview). You may have to try several times, but this should allow you to see the Infused Crystal.

## ![](https://dfk-hv.b-cdn.net/website-media/images/jewel-icon.png) HERO STATS, QUESTS, AND PROFESSIONS

### What are the different Hero rarities and what do they do?

Summoned heroes may be of the following rarities, indicated by the color of the card border:

* Mythic (Purple)
* Legendary (Orange)
* Rare (Blue)
* Uncommon (Green)
* Common (Grey)

Higher rarity heroes are summoned with increased stat values. Heroes that are Rare or above also receive additional stat increases every 5 levels. [Read more about hero stat values](https://defikingdoms.medium.com/breaking-down-advanced-hero-classes-stats-and-rarities-ce745dc5024).

### How do I know if my Hero is good?

We think that every hero is valuable to someone! But different heroes' classes and stat combinations may lend themselves to certain activities, whether particular quests, professions, or PVP. Look to see if your hero's boosted stats (in green, blue, or purple) align with their chosen profession (in green) or their [class/subclass's associated stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jfG6E6otW1V6ZLQycF5DumoBr\_LrpQaz7cTmDPpwV2s/edit#gid=785443787) (Google Docs link).

Certain classes, professions, rarities, and visual attributes may also be more desirable to players depending on their playstyle.

### What are the Green/Blue/Purple stats on my Hero?

Each hero's genes give it a boost to two stats, and make it naturally inclined toward one profession. Stat boosts are shown in green and blue on the back of the Hero card. If the two stat boosts are both for the same stat, it will be shown in purple.

There are two kinds of stat boosts, and every hero has one of each:

* A one-time +2 bonus to that stat number (green)
* An ongoing +2% bonus to the hero's Primary Growth Stat Value and +4% bonus to their Secondary Growth Stat Value (blue). These values increase the likelihood that stat will increase when the hero levels up.

Heroes will receive a nice bonus when doing profession quests that match their profession gene (green).

### How do Professions work?

Four different professions are available to heroes: Gardening, Mining, Fishing, and Foraging. Each profession has a profession skill associated with it which has a chance to increase each time a hero does an associated profession quest. As those skills increase, so too will the hero’s ability to earn rewards from that profession. In addition, each of these professions has a gene associated with it (in green on your hero card). Heroes receive additional benefits when doing profession quests that match their profession gene.

Engaging in a profession quest uses your hero's Stamina. Mining and Gardening drain stamina at a fixed rate every 10 minutes, as indicated in the quest menu, allowing the hero to work these quests over longer periods of time until they run out of stamina or until you stop them. Foraging and Fishing quests are shorter, consuming a larger amount of mana over a minimal duration, as shown in the quest menu. Fishing and foraging quests allow you to queue multiple quest attempts in one transaction, up to the maximum amount allowed by your hero's stamina. Heroes recover stamina at a rate of 1 every 20 minutes. _Note: Heroes cannot recover stamina while engaged in a quest._

## ![](https://dfk-hv.b-cdn.net/website-media/images/jewel-icon.png) KINGDOMS / LANDS

### What are Kingdoms/Land plots?

Kingdoms, or land plots, will be an additional kind of NFT that is limited in quantity and highly collectable. As the world map is revealed, players will be able to purchase plots of land where buildings can be constructed, and transactions and quests can take place. Land owners will receive a portion of the revenue generated on their plots!

### How do I purchase land or participate in the land airdrop?

25 Kingdom Plots will be given to random winners from people who had at least 5,000 xJEWEL tokens in their bank balance by Nov 13, 2021 _(For each additional 5000 xJEWEL a player has in the bank, they will get 2 extra entries in the drawing of random winners.)_

25 more Kingdom Plots will be given to random winners from people who had at least 1,000 xJEWEL tokens in their bank balance by Nov 13, 2021. Additional snapshots will be taken every 8 to 12 hours for 4 weeks, ending on Dec 11, 2021. Total number of entries will be determined by average amount of xJEWEL across all snapshots for all holders who qualified during the initial snapshot. _(For each additional 1,000 xJEWEL a player has in the bank, they will receive 2 extra entries.)_

Land plots will be available for purchase during [Phase 3 of the Roadmap](https://github.com/dfk-ita-staff/docs/blob/master/roadmap/phrase-3-world-map-and-land.md). **Only players who actively participate in the game by leveling heroes and doing quests/professions will be eligible to purchase land plots.**
